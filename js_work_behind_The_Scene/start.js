// ============== High Level 
//js is  a high level language => developer do not need to manage resources
//other language like c & c ++ are low level language => means can directly intaract with cpu & memory => developer need to manage resources

// ============ garbage collector
// Js have a cleaning guy who cleans all the memory time to time so that you don't have to clean the memoery by yourself 

// ========== interpreted or just in time compiled
// computer only understand 0 & 1 => but in js we have an abstraction to write code for this like using variable & datatypes 
// which gets convert to machine code by getting compiled => this happens inside the JS engine

// =========== Multi paradgime
//paradgime : an approach and mindset of structure code which will direct your coding style & technique.

// Procedural programming => currently Learning
// Object oriented programming
// Functional programming => Mostly used

// ========== Prototype based Object oriented 
// 

//=========== First Class function
// close clisemodal(){
    // modal.classlist(/btn-new).add('hidden)
// }

// overlay.addeventlistner('click', closeModal); => //passing a function into another function as an argument, First-Class Function 


// ==========Dynamic
// let x =23;
// let y = 25;
// x = 'Jhon' => // js automatically change Datatype dynamically 

// ================ Single threaded ================ Non Blocking Event loop ======================

// ==> concurrency Model = how js handle multiple tasks happening at the same time => why do we need that ðŸ‘‡
// ==> Javscript runs in one single thread so it can do one thing at a single time  ðŸ‘‡=> what about a long running task 
// ==> sounds like it would block the single threaded but we want non blocking behaviour! ðŸ‘‡ => how do we achive that

// ==> by using a "event loop" takes long running task executes them in the "background" and puts them back in the main thread once they are finshed 

// 'use strict'
